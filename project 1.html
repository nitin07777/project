<p><b>A flag is a symbol that represents a country, organisation or idea. it is usually made of 
cloth and has a specific design of colors, shapes and symbols that hold deep meaning. every nation
has it's own unique flag that reflect it's history, culture and values. for example, the indian
national flag, also known as the **Tiranga**, has three horizontal stripes of saffron, white and
green. in the centre is a navy blue Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes. each color of th flag has it's
own meaning: saffron represents courage and sacrifice, white stands for peace and truth and green
symbolises faith and prosperity. the Ashoka Chakra signifies the eternal wheel of law. people show 
great respect and pride for their national flag, especially on important occasion like 
**Independence day** and **Republic day**. the flag is hoisted with honor, and citizens often 
sing the national anthem while saluting it. it serves as a reminder of the struggles and 
sacrifices made by freedom fighters. the flag also unites people of different cultures and
backgrounds under the identity. in this way, a flag is not just a piece of fabric it is a symbol
of unity, pride and national identity.</b></p><br>
